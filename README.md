# codeigniter4-webp
Library Convertion WebP for Codeigniter 4

## About

WebP is a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. Using WebP,
webmasters and web developers can create smaller, richer images that make the web faster.

WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25-34% smaller than comparable JPEG
images at equivalent SSIM quality index.

Lossless WebP supports transparency (also known as alpha channel) at a cost of just 22% additional bytes. For cases when
lossy RGB compression is acceptable, lossy WebP also supports transparency, typically providing 3Ã— smaller file sizes
compared to PNG.

`cwebp` compresses an image using the WebP format. Input format can be either `PNG`, `JPEG`, `TIFF`, `WebP` or
raw `Y'CbCr` samples.
